Using AdventOfCode as an opportunity to get better at Golang.

## Tests

`go test ./...` to run all or `go test ./dayXX` for each day.

## Solutions

`go run ./dayXX <input>` for days 01 through 04.

`go run ./dayXX` for days 05 and above (when I learned about the `embed` package).

## Highlights

Day 11: _[Compressed Sparse Column matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix)_ implementation, with run-length encoded column indices.

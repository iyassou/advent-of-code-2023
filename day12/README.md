# First impressions

I'm not confident with combinatorial problems like these, they make me feel like my maths degree is a sham. Time to prove myself wrong or fail trying haha.

Looking at the individual input data, they're not pathologically long, sooooo: what if I brute-force the unknowns and check for a regex match?

# Part One

As much as I have been enjoying the benefits of TDD, old habits die hard and I did not follow that approach this time around, mostly out of laziness I'd say. Wrote my code, then debugged with print statements until I got the example cases right. Test was written retrospectively: there is some discipline to be worked on here.

Anyway, brute force works ⭐ Can't wait to see how part two makes this infeasible.

Right.

> As you look out at the field of springs, you feel like there are way more springs than the condition records list. When you examine the records, you discover that they were actually *folded up* this whole time!

> To *unfold the records*, on each row, replace the list of spring conditions with **five copies of itself** (separated by `?`) and replace the list of contiguous groups of damaged springs with **five copies of itself** (separated by `,`).

I've spent quite a few hours going down the nonograms, discrete tomography, and reconstructing hv-convex sets from their horizontal and vertical x-rays, rabbit holes without actually making any progress, so I'm gonna leave this here for now and move on to day 13.

I'm in a rush to get to a Christmas meal so I decided to skip the tests for this one. I'll flesh them out tomorrow.

I briefly learned about how Go represents time durations, and am really enjoying how much a statically typed, compiled language's speed overcomes potentially slow code (889.7404ms for part two), even though I know I shouldn't rely on that and still strive to write efficient code. ⭐⭐

Christmas meal was a hoot 🎄🥘🍻

I've added basic tests now. Gonna look into making some pretty changes to my repo's README now.
